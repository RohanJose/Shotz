Core Framework & Language
React (v19): The library used for building the user interface.

TypeScript: The programming language used (evident by the .tsx files and interface definitions), providing type safety.

ES Modules & Import Maps: The site uses modern browser standards to load libraries directly from a CDN (esm.sh) without a traditional bundler (like Webpack or Vite) in this specific environment.

Styling & Design
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for almost all styling (layout, colors, spacing). It is loaded via CDN with a custom configuration script to define the "SHOTZ" brand colors (shotz-lime, shotz-yellow, etc.) and fonts.

Custom CSS: Specific styles injected via <style> tags for things Tailwind can't do easily, like the custom scrollbar, the infinite marquee animation keyframes, and the glitch effects.

Google Fonts:

Bangers: The loud, comic-book style display font.

Permanent Marker: The handwritten brush font.

Poppins: The clean sans-serif font for body text.

Animation & Interaction
Framer Motion: The heavy-lifting animation library used for:

Scroll-triggered animations (Parallax effects on the hero section).

Physics-based spring animations (The smooth floating stars).

Page transitions and mobile menu entry/exit animations (AnimatePresence).

Hover effects (scaling bottles, rotating elements).

Assets & Icons
Lucide React: The library used for the icons (Menu, X, Instagram, Droplet, etc.).

SVG Graphics: Vector graphics used for the Logo, Mascots, and Stars to ensure they stay crisp at any size.

Noise Texture: A background noise pattern (grainy-gradients.vercel.app) used to give the site a textured, retro feel.

Browser APIs
Intersection Observer: (Implicitly used by Framer Motion whileInView).

Resize Observer: (Implicitly used by Framer Motion)
